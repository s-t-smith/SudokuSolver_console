/*
* SudokuSolver.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
* The program will make use of the Sudoku classes to create a 9x9 game board and input solutions until the board has all digits (1..9) in each row, column and 3x3 block.
* The algorithm will follow these steps:
* - Eliminate possible solution notes in a row
* - Eliminate possible solution notes in a column
* - Eliminate possible solution notes in a block
* - Iterate through each row to find singular solution notes, write solutions where applicable
* - Iterate through each column to find singular solution notes, write solutions where applicable
* - Iterate through each block to find singular solution notes, write solutions where applicable
* - Continue until all cells have solutions written
